# 🌟 **Pattern-of-Life Analysis for Bluetooth & BLE Devices** 🌟  
🚀 **Final Report by Team INSuRE Fall 2022** 🚀  

## 🧐 **What’s This About?**  
Ever wondered how your Bluetooth and BLE devices "live their lives"? We explored their **Pattern-of-Life** to uncover baseline behaviors and pinpoint "weird" or **abnormal patterns**. It's all about making Bluetooth interactions **smarter and safer!** 🔒

---

## 🔍 **Quick Glimpse**  
**🎯 Short Phrase:**  
Refining innovative methods to analyze and secure Bluetooth and BLE devices.  

**⚡ Keywords:**  
Pattern-of-Life | Bluetooth | BLE | Packets | Security | IoT  

**✨ Cool Fact:**  
We tracked data from devices like Apple Pencils and Bluetooth keyboards to understand how these gadgets "talk" and where they might slip up!

---

## 🛠️ **How We Did It**  
- **🔧 Toolkit:** Raspberry Pi, Ubertooth One, Wireshark, RStudio, and custom Python scripts.  
- **👩‍🔬 Our Process:** Captured BLE packets, visualized traffic with time-series graphs, and analyzed anomalies using Wireshark and Python adaptations.  
- **🤖 Challenges We Tackled:** Overcame device interference, debugged complex Python scripts, and unraveled MAC address randomization mysteries.  

---

## 🎉 **What We Found**  
💡 **Breakthrough:** We successfully created a Pattern-of-Life graph for the **Apple Pencil**! 🖋️  
❌ **Setbacks:** Limited success with other devices like TaoTronics earbuds due to data quirks.  

---

## 🔭 **Why It Matters?**  
Bluetooth devices are everywhere — homes, offices, even your car! 🚗  
Securing them is **crucial** in an era where IoT is booming. 🌐 Our findings help pave the way for better **monitoring** and **defense mechanisms** against vulnerabilities. 🔐
